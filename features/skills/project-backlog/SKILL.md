# Project Backlog Skill

## Overview

This skill manages a three-stage project lifecycle for ideas and
initiatives:

1. **Backlog** — Capture ideas in a compact list. Items are brief and
   lightweight. The backlog stays reasonably sized; it is not a task tracker.
2. **Specification** — Promote backlog items into dedicated spec directories
   for detailed design. Iterate on specs until they are ready for execution.
3. **Archive** — After a spec is executed, move its directory to an archive
   so it is no longer front-and-center.

The backlog and all specs live under `specs/` at the project root.

## Directory Structure

```
<project-root>/specs/
├── project-backlog.md              # Compact backlog list (Stage 1)
├── <item-slug>/                    # Promoted spec directory (Stage 2)
│   ├── spec.md                     #   Primary specification (required)
│   └── <auxiliary>.md              #   Supporting files (optional)
└── archive/                        # Completed specs (Stage 3)
    └── <item-slug>/                #   Archived spec directory
        ├── spec.md
        └── <auxiliary>.md
```

**Naming conventions:**

- Spec directories use kebab-case slugs derived from the backlog item title
- The primary spec file is always `spec.md`
- Auxiliary files use descriptive kebab-case names
- `archive/` is a flat collection of completed spec directories

## Scope

**In-scope:**

- Adding, listing, modifying, and removing backlog items
- Promoting backlog items into spec directories
- Iterating on existing specifications
- Adding auxiliary files to spec directories
- Archiving completed specs after execution
- Listing active and archived specs

**Out-of-scope:**

- Project implementation (the skill prepares specs for execution; it does
  not implement them)
- Task tracking with statuses, assignments, or priorities

## Backlog File Format

```markdown
# Project Backlog

Ideas and initiatives to be fleshed out later. Items here are compact
— just enough context to remember the idea. Promote items to full
specifications when ready to design them in detail.

## Category Name

### Item Title

Brief description — a few sentences capturing the idea, context, and
initial thoughts. Keep it concise.
```

Items should be short. If a description is growing past a short paragraph,
that is a signal to promote it to a spec.

## Spec File Format

When creating or iterating on `spec.md` files, follow the canonical
specification structure defined in
[spec-structure.md](references/spec-structure.md). See
[example-spec.md](references/example-spec.md) for a complete filled
example.

Auxiliary files are added as needed during iteration: research notes,
diagrams, sub-specifications, or any supporting material that would clutter
the primary spec.

## Procedure

### Stage 1: Backlog Management

#### Adding an Item

1. Read `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Determine whether the item fits an existing category or needs a new one.
3. Append the item with a `### Title` heading and a brief description.
4. Confirm the addition to the user in one line.
5. Return to whatever the user was doing before — do not disrupt the current
   conversation's focus.

#### Listing the Backlog

1. Read `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Present the items to the user, optionally filtered by category if
   requested.

#### Modifying an Item

1. Read `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Locate the item by title.
3. Update the description, title, or category as requested.

#### Removing an Item

1. Read `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Locate the item by title. If multiple items share the same title across
   categories, disambiguate by category before proceeding.
3. Remove the `### Title` heading and its description. If this leaves an
   empty category (a `## Category` heading with no items beneath it), remove
   the empty category heading as well.

#### Handling Ambiguity

When an operation targets an item "by title" and multiple items share the
same or similar title across categories, ask the user to clarify which item
they mean by presenting the category and title of each match.

### Stage 2: Specification Management

#### Promoting a Backlog Item to Spec

1. Read the target item from `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Derive a kebab-case slug from the item title
   (e.g., "Centralized Documentation Source" → `centralized-docs`).
3. Check whether `specs/<slug>/` already exists. If it does, ask the user
   whether to merge into the existing spec or choose a different slug.
4. Create the directory `specs/<slug>/`.
5. Create `specs/<slug>/spec.md` following the structure in
   [spec-structure.md](references/spec-structure.md), expanding the backlog
   description into a full specification.
6. Remove the item from `project-backlog.md`. If this leaves an empty
   category, remove the empty category heading.
7. Present the new spec to the user for review or further iteration.

#### Iterating on a Spec

1. Read the contents of the spec directory to understand its current state.
2. Read `spec.md` (and any relevant auxiliary files).
3. Update based on user input — expand sections, resolve open questions,
   add design detail.
4. If the user provides new supporting material, create auxiliary files
   alongside `spec.md`.

#### Adding Auxiliary Files

1. Create the file in the spec directory with a descriptive kebab-case name.
2. Reference it from `spec.md` if appropriate.

#### Listing Active Specs

1. List directories under `specs/` (excluding `archive/` and the
   `project-backlog.md` file).
2. For each directory, read the first few lines of `spec.md` to present a
   summary.

### Stage 3: Execution and Archive

#### Pulling a Spec for Execution

1. Read the spec directory contents.
2. Read `spec.md` and any auxiliary files.
3. Present the full specification to guide the implementation session.

#### Archiving a Completed Spec

1. Confirm the spec has been executed or is no longer needed.
2. Check whether `specs/archive/<slug>/` already exists. If it does, ask
   the user how to proceed (e.g., rename with a suffix, overwrite).
3. Move the entire `specs/<slug>/` directory to `specs/archive/<slug>/`.
4. Confirm the archival to the user.

#### Listing Archived Specs

1. List directories under `specs/archive/`.
2. For each, read the first few lines of `spec.md` to present a summary.

## Constraints

**MUST:**

- Store the backlog at `specs/project-backlog.md`.
- Create spec directories matching the item slug in kebab-case.
- Name the primary spec file `spec.md` in every spec directory.
- Follow kebab-case naming for all files and directories.
- Follow the specification structure in
  [spec-structure.md](references/spec-structure.md) when creating or
  updating `spec.md` files.
- Keep quick-capture (add to backlog) to a single edit and a one-line
  confirmation — do not disrupt the user's current work.
- Preserve existing backlog category structure when adding items.
- Remove items from the backlog when they are promoted to specs.
- Move (not copy) spec directories to `archive/` on completion.

**MUST NOT:**

- Add status fields, priority numbers, or other project-management metadata
  to backlog items. The backlog is a list of ideas, not a kanban board.
- Leave promoted items in the backlog after creating their spec directory.
- Create specs as standalone files — every spec gets its own directory, even
  if it is a single file.
- Delete archived specs. The archive is append-only.

**MAY:**

- Create new backlog categories when an item does not fit existing ones.
- Suggest promotion when a backlog item's description is growing too long.
- Include a brief archival note at the top of `spec.md` when archiving,
  noting when and why it was archived.
- Nest one level of subdirectories within a spec directory for complex specs
  (e.g., `specs/<slug>/research/`).

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Capture During Unrelated Work

**Scenario:** The user is debugging a test failure and mentions "oh, also
add an idea for a CLI dashboard tool to the backlog."

**Action:**

1. Read `specs/project-backlog.md`.
2. Append under the most fitting category (or create `## Tooling` if none
   fits):

```markdown
### CLI Dashboard Tool

A terminal-based dashboard for monitoring project status across
repositories.
```

3. Respond: "Added **CLI Dashboard Tool** to the backlog under Tooling."
4. Continue with the debugging work.

---

### Example 2: Promoting an Item to a Spec

**Scenario:** The user says "promote the centralized docs idea to a spec."

**Action:**

1. Read the "Centralized Documentation Source" item from the backlog.
2. Create `specs/centralized-docs/`.
3. Create `specs/centralized-docs/spec.md` following the canonical structure
   from [spec-structure.md](references/spec-structure.md), expanding the
   backlog description into a full specification with Problem/Purpose, Scope,
   Goals, Use Cases, Requirements, Proposed Design, and relevant
   cross-cutting concerns.
4. Remove "Centralized Documentation Source" from `project-backlog.md`.
5. Present the spec for review.

---

### Example 3: Iterating on a Spec

**Scenario:** The user says "add a section about the GHA component design
to the centralized docs spec."

**Action:**

1. Read `specs/centralized-docs/spec.md`.
2. Add or expand the relevant section based on user input.
3. If the detail is extensive, create
   `specs/centralized-docs/gha-component-design.md` as an auxiliary file
   and reference it from `spec.md`.

---

### Example 4: Archiving a Completed Spec

**Scenario:** The user says "the centralized docs spec has been implemented,
archive it."

**Action:**

1. Move `specs/centralized-docs/` to `specs/archive/centralized-docs/`.
2. Respond: "Archived **centralized-docs** spec."

---

### Example 5: Listing Active Work

**Scenario:** The user says "what specs are in progress?"

**Action:**

1. List directories under `specs/` (excluding `archive/` and
   `project-backlog.md`).
2. Read the first heading from each `spec.md`.
3. Present a summary list.
