# PowerShell Standards and Patterns

## Core Principles

1. OOP first for full scripts
2. Guard clauses at function entry
3. Fail fast on invalid preconditions
4. Parameterize everything that changes

## Script Start Requirement

- Full scripts MUST start with comment-based help that includes `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.EXAMPLE`, and `.NOTES`.
- Place the help block before `[CmdletBinding()]` or `param()`.

## Full Script Structure

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Short summary.

.DESCRIPTION
Thorough explanation of purpose, behavior, and output.

.EXAMPLE
Example invocation and what it does.

.NOTES
When to use, when not to use, and any prerequisites.
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param()

## Object-Oriented Design

- All business logic belongs in classes.
- Use hidden helper methods for nested logic.
- Keep functions as orchestration only.

## Guard Clauses and Error Messages

- Validate inputs first, then execute logic.
- Errors must include: process, error, cause, and solution.

Example format:

```
Process: Setting value in registry.
Error: Access denied.
Cause: Missing permissions.
Solution: Run as administrator.
```

## Parameter Validation

Use attributes on every parameter:

- `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty`
- `ValidateSet`
- `ValidateRange`
- `ValidateScript`
- `ValidatePattern`

## Naming Conventions

| Element         | Convention        | Examples                        |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Functions       | Verb-Noun         | `Get-Item`, `Set-RegistryValue` |
| Parameters      | PascalCase        | `$RegistryPath`                 |
| Variables       | PascalCase        | `$BackupPath`                   |
| Classes         | PascalCase        | `RegistryManager`               |
| Private Members | Underscore prefix | `_ValidateInput()`              |

## Nesting and Extraction

- Max 3 levels of nesting.
- Extract deeper logic into class methods.

## Logging and Output

- Use `Write-Verbose` for diagnostics.
- Use `Write-Information` for user-facing status.
- Return objects, not formatted strings, unless requested.

### Verbose Logging (Performance)

Avoid expensive string construction when verbose logging is disabled. Guard heavy work behind a verbose check and only build strings inside that block.

```powershell
if ($VerbosePreference -eq 'Continue') {
	$details = Get-HeavyDiagnostics -Path $Path
	Write-Verbose ("[Scan] Details: {0}" -f $details)
}
```

When you need structured data, compute it only inside the verbose branch or pass a simple identifier until verbose is enabled.

## Advanced Features

- Use `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]` when the action is destructive.
- Use pipeline support only when it reduces friction.
