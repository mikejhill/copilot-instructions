# Intent Files

Intent files record the operator's goals, priorities, and decision history
for a Copilot feature. They serve as governance documents for feature
creation, regeneration, and ongoing maintenance.

## Purpose

When agents create or iterate on features, the operator's original goals and
accumulated decisions are lost between sessions. Intent files preserve this
context so that:

- A feature can be regenerated from goals alone.
- Iterative enhancements are recorded as they happen.
- Feature quality can be judged against stated goals.
- New agents inherit the operator's priorities without re-explanation.

## Audience

Intent files are for:

- **Human operators** reviewing or updating their features.
- **Agents creating or maintaining features** (e.g., via the
  `copilot-features` skill or refinement workflows).

Intent files are NOT for agents consuming the feature. An agent invoking
`#python-scripting` does not need the python-scripting intent file.

## File Placement

| Feature type       | Intent file                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Agent skills       | `<skill-directory>/INTENT.md`         |
| Instructions files | `<instructions-dir>/<name>.intent.md` |
| Prompt files       | `<prompts-dir>/<name>.intent.md`      |
| Custom agents      | `<agents-dir>/<name>.intent.md`       |
| Agent hooks        | `<hooks-dir>/<name>.intent.md`        |

Skills use `INTENT.md` (uppercase) because they have a dedicated directory.
Flat-file features use `<name>.intent.md` as a companion file in the same
directory as the feature. Reference resources do not use intent files — they
serve a parent feature whose intent file covers them.

Intent files MUST NOT be included in a skill's frontmatter `references` list.
They are not loaded when the feature is invoked.

## Format

````markdown
# Intent

One-line statement of what this feature does and why it exists.

## Goals

1. Most important goal — wins when goals conflict
2. Second priority goal
3. Additional goals as needed

## Log

- YYYY-MM-DD: Description of a decision, change, or observation
````

### Sections

#### Purpose line

A single sentence after the `# Intent` heading. States the feature's reason
for existence. This anchors all other content — goals and log entries are
interpreted relative to this purpose.

#### Goals

Numbered list ordered by priority. When goals conflict during feature
development, higher-ranked goals win. Goals MUST be:

- **Declarative** — state what, not how
- **Testable** — an observer can judge whether the feature meets the goal
- **Stable** — goals change infrequently; implementation details change often

Aim for 3–7 goals. Fewer than 3 suggests under-specification. More than 7
suggests the feature's scope is too broad or goals are too granular.

#### Log

Append-only chronological record. Each entry is a single line with a date
prefix. Two categories:

- **Operator entries** — Decisions made by the human operator. No prefix
  beyond the date.
- **Agent entries** — Observations or changes recorded by an agent during
  feature iteration. Prefixed with `[agent]` after the date.

The distinction matters: operator entries are authoritative decisions; agent
entries are informational records the operator may later promote, revise,
or remove.

## Agent Behavior

### Creating a feature from an intent file

1. Read the intent file.
2. Treat goals as binding requirements ordered by priority.
3. Treat log entries as context — they inform implementation but do not
   override goals.
4. Create the feature. Do NOT modify the intent file during initial creation.

### Iterating on an existing feature

1. Read the intent file to understand goals and history.
2. Make the requested changes to the feature.
3. Append a log entry summarizing what changed and why. Use the `[agent]`
   prefix.
4. Do NOT modify existing goals or log entries unless the operator explicitly
   asks.

### Updating goals

When the operator asks to change goals:

1. Edit the Goals section as directed.
2. Append a log entry noting the goal change.
